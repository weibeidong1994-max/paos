# Agent 协作规范

This repository is a Go CLI project in stabilization. Treat documentation and execution rules as part of the product.

## Working Rules

1. Start by checking the current tree and the exact files that are in scope.
2. Do not revert user changes unless explicitly asked.
3. Prefer `apply_patch` for edits and avoid destructive commands.
4. Keep changes scoped; if a task crosses file boundaries, state the boundary before editing.
5. Preserve CLI and documentation compatibility unless the task explicitly calls for a breaking change.
6. When a task depends on providers, themes, or prompt templates, prefer CLI discovery output over guessing or stale docs.

## Discovery-First Workflow

Before assuming a feature, resource, or prompt exists, inspect the running CLI:

1. `md2wechat capabilities --json`
2. `md2wechat providers list --json`
3. `md2wechat themes list --json`
4. `md2wechat prompts list --json`

Use `show` or `render` only when a task depends on a specific resource:

1. `md2wechat providers show <name> --json`
2. `md2wechat themes show <name> --json`
3. `md2wechat prompts show <name> --kind <kind> --json`
4. `md2wechat prompts render <name> --kind <kind> --var KEY=VALUE --json`

Treat these commands as the source of truth for:

- currently supported image providers
- currently visible themes after override resolution
- bundled and overridden prompt catalog entries

## Verification Order

1. Run `gofmt -l .` when Go files change.
2. Run `go vet ./...` after structural changes.
3. Run `make quality-gates` before declaring release-related or CI-sensitive work done. This is the local source of truth for the same gate sequence enforced in GitHub Actions.
4. Run `GOCACHE=/tmp/md2wechat-go-build go test ./...` for focused regression work when you do not need the full gate.
5. Run `GOCACHE=/tmp/md2wechat-go-build go test -cover ./...` when coverage is part of the task.
6. If `make release-check` exists in this branch, keep it green, but do not treat it as a substitute for `make quality-gates`.
7. When release assets or installer scripts change, run artifact smoke and installer smoke against the same bundle before calling the work done.
8. If the task touches release or installer paths, keep the documented primary path versioned and non-`latest`.
9. If the task touches Homebrew distribution, verify the tap formula is generated from the same release bundle and points only to versioned release assets.
10. If the task publishes a new npm version, manually trigger `npx cnpm sync @geekjourneyx/md2wechat` after npm publish so `npmmirror` users do not get a stale tarball 404 on the fresh release.

## Test Discipline

Tests are part of the product contract, not a coverage vanity metric.

When adding or changing a command, workflow, or user-facing behavior, start from first principles:

1. Which failure would most damage user trust?
2. Which failure would most mislead an agent into taking the wrong next step?
3. Which boundary must stay identical across `inspect`, `preview`, `convert`, `upload`, and `draft`?

Required rules:

1. Do not add tests just to raise a coverage number.
2. Prefer tests that protect a real contract, invariant, or blocking user workflow.
3. If a new command or feature changes a decision boundary, add tests for both the accepted path and the rejected path.
4. If a new feature introduces a “confirmation” step, its tests must prove that the confirmation layer stays aligned with the execution layer.
5. When behavior depends on combinations of inputs, prefer table-driven matrix tests over one-off happy-path tests.
6. When the code talks to external systems, keep a small number of real smoke tests, but make the default regression suite deterministic and local-first.
7. If a test is brittle, environment-dependent, or mostly re-tests implementation details without protecting user trust, do not add it unless there is a concrete regression history behind it.
8. A change is not CI-safe until the exact local gate that CI runs has passed. Do not rely on “I ran tests” if CI also runs lint, formatting, or release-consistency checks that you did not run locally.

Priority order for effective tests:

1. CLI contract tests
   - invalid input rejection
   - exit codes
   - JSON envelope / stdout stability
2. confirmation-vs-execution consistency tests
   - `inspect` / `preview` must not declare a path ready when `convert` / `draft` would fail
3. blocking readiness matrix tests
   - metadata limits
   - missing local assets
   - missing or invalid cover
   - missing credentials
4. core publish-path tests
   - asset rewrite
   - draft mapping
   - WeChat error translation
5. real smoke tests for one minimal external closed loop

Coverage guidance:

1. Low coverage alone is not a reason to add tests.
2. High-risk modules with stable contracts should be covered before low-risk helper modules.
3. A smaller set of durable, high-signal tests is better than broad but shallow assertion spam.
4. If `go test -cover ./...` is unreliable in the current environment, do not force it blindly; document the limitation and keep the deterministic subset healthy.

## Release And Version Discipline

1. Keep the version source singular and explicit when the repository has one.
2. Keep install scripts, release notes, changelog, and release assets aligned.
3. If the repository does not yet provide a workflow or release gate, document the gap instead of inventing it.
4. Release work is not complete until these are explicitly re-audited and aligned:
   - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
   - `skills/md2wechat/SKILL.md`
   - `platforms/openclaw/md2wechat/SKILL.md`
   - `scripts/install.sh`
   - `scripts/install-openclaw.sh`
   - `platforms/openclaw/md2wechat/SKILL.md`
   - `docs/INSTALL.md`
   - `docs/FAQ.md`
5. If any of the files above still carry an old version, stale release URL, stale maintainer identity, or outdated command examples, block the release and fix them before tagging.

## Documentation Discipline

1. Document only supported paths as the primary path.
2. Label aspirational or not-yet-shipped paths clearly.
3. If a feature is not backed by current code or release assets, do not describe it as shipped.
4. Prefer short, operational instructions over marketing copy.
5. If any CLI command, subcommand, flag, JSON response shape, prompt asset, provider, or theme behavior changes, treat documentation sync as part of the same task.
6. The minimum documentation review set for CLI changes is:
   - `README.md`
   - `docs/DISCOVERY.md`
   - `docs/FAQ.md`
   - the relevant `SKILL.md`
7. If the CLI change affects setup, config, install, or migration behavior, also review:
   - `docs/CONFIG.md`
   - `docs/QUICKSTART.md`
   - `docs/USAGE.md`
   - `docs/OPENCLAW.md` when platform behavior changes
8. Do not stop at “updated one doc”. Re-audit the highest-signal entry points so user-facing docs, agent-facing docs, and CLI behavior stay aligned.
9. When image prompts change, treat both skill entry points as mandatory review targets:
   - `skills/md2wechat/SKILL.md`
   - `platforms/openclaw/md2wechat/SKILL.md`
10. Keep configuration naming layers explicit:
   - config-file YAML keys such as `api.image_base_url`
   - environment variables such as `IMAGE_API_BASE`
   - `config show --format json` output keys such as `image_api_base`
   Do not mix these three layers in docs or agent guidance.

## Image Prompt Discipline

When adding or changing `internal/assets/builtin/prompts/image/*.yaml`, treat the change as a product contract update, not just a content tweak.

Minimum required fields for builtin image prompts:

- `name`
- `kind: image`
- `description`
- `version`
- `archetype`
- `primary_use_case`
- `recommended_aspect_ratios`
- `default_aspect_ratio`
- `metadata.author`
- `metadata.provenance`
- `template`

Use these when applicable:

- `compatible_use_cases`
- `tags`
- `examples`
- `metadata.inspired_by`

Required constraints:

1. `default_aspect_ratio` must appear in `recommended_aspect_ratios`.
2. If a preset can serve both cover and infographic scenarios, express that through `compatible_use_cases` rather than duplicating the preset.
3. Do not move long image prompts back into Go code when the prompt catalog can carry them.

Required verification after image prompt changes:

1. `gofmt -l .`
2. `GOCACHE=/tmp/md2wechat-go-build go test ./internal/promptcatalog ./cmd/md2wechat`
3. `GOCACHE=/tmp/md2wechat-go-build go test ./...`
4. Re-audit:
   - `README.md`
   - `docs/DISCOVERY.md`
   - `docs/FAQ.md`
   - `skills/md2wechat/SKILL.md`
   - `platforms/openclaw/md2wechat/SKILL.md`

The repository should fail closed on prompt drift: missing primary use case, default aspect ratio, or attribution metadata should be blocked by tests rather than caught manually later.

## Escalation

1. Ask for approval before commands that require network access or writing outside the workspace.
2. If a command fails because of sandboxing, rerun it with the required escalation instead of working around it.
