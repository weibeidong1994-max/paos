## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.7] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Added `volcengine` / `volc` as a built-in image provider for Volcengine Ark, with support for `doubao-seedream-5-0-260128` and `doubao-seedream-5-0-lite-260128`.
- Added provider-level `supported_models` discovery to `providers list --json`, `providers show --json`, and `capabilities --json`, so agents and scripts can inspect image model catalogs before choosing `--model`.

### Changed
- Switched `config init` and the bundled example config to a `volcengine` image setup by default, including the Ark base URL, default Seedream model, and `2K` size tier.
- Made image defaults provider-aware, so Volcengine now falls back to `2K` when `api.image_size` is omitted instead of inheriting an OpenAI-shaped square size.
- Consolidated image-provider model metadata into the shared provider registry and re-audited high-signal docs and both skill entry points to keep provider, model, and discovery guidance aligned.
- Removed the `skills/md2wechat/references/` directory and folded the remaining guidance back into the main `SKILL.md` entry point.

### Fixed
- Fixed Volcengine `ModelNotOpen` guidance to point users to the Doubao model activation path instead of a vague Ark-console hint.
- Fixed JSON-mode CLI tests to stream captured stdout/stderr safely, preventing large discovery payloads from deadlocking the test process.

## [2.0.6] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- Added an npm distribution package at `@geekjourneyx/md2wechat` so users can install the CLI through `npm install -g` without compiling Go locally.
- Added `scripts/install.js` and `scripts/run.js` as a thin npm wrapper layer that downloads the version-matched GitHub Release binary and verifies `checksums.txt`.
- Added `--cover-media-id` for `convert --draft` and `inspect --draft`, so article drafts can reuse an existing WeChat permanent cover asset without re-uploading a local file.

### Changed
- Updated the release workflow so npm packaging is smoked against the same release artifact on Linux and Windows before publish, then published to npm only after the GitHub Release assets are live.
- Extended local and CI quality gates to validate npm package contents and keep `package.json`, `VERSION`, and marketplace metadata aligned.
- Updated install documentation to include the npm path while keeping Homebrew, fixed-version installers, and Go install as first-class alternatives.
- Tightened both skill entry points so `小绿书` / `图文笔记` / `newspic` requests route to `create_image_post` instead of being treated as standard article drafts.
- Narrowed the npm support contract to the actual published release matrix: macOS `amd64/arm64`, Linux `amd64/arm64`, and Windows `amd64`.

### Fixed
- Fixed Windows npm smoke and local-bundle installs by treating Windows drive-letter paths in `MD2WECHAT_RELEASE_BASE_URL` as local filesystem paths instead of unsupported URL schemes.
- Fixed agent-facing draft guidance so README, usage docs, and both `SKILL.md` entry points consistently describe `--cover` and `--cover-media-id` as the valid draft-cover contract.
- Closed documentation drift around image-provider setup by removing stale `GOOGLE_API_KEY` guidance and keeping Gemini/Google instructions aligned on `IMAGE_API_KEY`.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Added `inspect` as a release-grade confirmation command that resolves final article metadata, readiness, and publish risks before conversion or draft creation.
- Added `preview` as a lightweight standalone HTML preview flow that writes a local preview artifact without upload or draft side effects.
- Added a typed `internal/inspect` confirmation layer so metadata sources, readiness, and checks are computed once and reused by CLI and preview flows.

### Changed
- Updated `capabilities --json` to advertise `inspect` and `preview` as first-class commands.
- Kept the preview implementation Go-only with embedded template rendering instead of introducing a separate frontend stack or editable workbench.
- Clarified that API mode can produce exact preview HTML when conversion succeeds, while AI mode degrades honestly to a confirmation page instead of pretending to show final layout.
- Reframed installer next steps and the main README around a confirm-first flow: `inspect` -> `preview` -> `convert` / `--draft`.

### Fixed
- Closed documentation drift around release version anchors by updating install and high-signal entry-point docs to `2.0.5`.
- Closed agent drift by updating both skill entry points to describe the new confirm-first flow and AI preview degradation behavior consistently.
- Tightened `scripts/release-check.sh` so version anchors, marketplace metadata, confirm-first docs, and both skill entry points are verified together before release work is considered done.
- Fixed JSON-mode CLI behavior so `inspect --json`, `preview --json`, and related machine-readable commands no longer mix config banners into stdout.
- Fixed `convert --preview` to emit pure HTML on stdout instead of wrapped terminal markers, making redirect-to-file and agent use more reliable.
- Fixed WeChat draft error guidance so `45004` now points users and agents to digest/description limits instead of encouraging body-content guesswork.
- Re-audited README, USAGE, DISCOVERY, FAQ, and both skill entry points to keep metadata-vs-body semantics, preview behavior, and image replacement rules aligned.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **CLI flags for article metadata**: Added `--title`, `--author`, and `--digest` flags to `convert` command for explicit metadata override
- **Metadata validation**: Added length validation for title (32 chars), author (16 chars), and digest (128 chars) with clear error messages
- **Frontmatter stripping**: `convert` now properly strips frontmatter from markdown body before passing to converter, preventing metadata from appearing in generated HTML
- **ArticleDocument structure**: Introduced `ArticleDocument` to separate metadata extraction from body parsing, improving testability

### Changed
- **background_type default**: Changed default `background_type` from `default` to `none` for cleaner output
- **Metadata priority**: Clarified metadata resolution order: CLI flags → frontmatter → first markdown heading → fallback
- **Test coverage**: Added comprehensive tests for metadata override, frontmatter stripping, and validation

### Fixed
- Fixed metadata extraction to properly handle `digest`, `summary`, and `description` frontmatter fields with correct priority
- Fixed first-line title fallback logic to avoid treating non-heading body text as title
- Fixed outdated documentation about background_type default value

### Technical Details
- **New Files**: None (structure changes only)
- **Modified Files**:
  - `cmd/md2wechat/convert.go` - Added CLI flags, validation, and document parsing
  - `cmd/md2wechat/convert_test.go` - Added 4 new test cases
  - `internal/converter/metadata.go` - Added `ArticleDocument` and `ParseArticleDocument`
  - `internal/converter/converter.go` - Added `normalizeRequest` to handle metadata merging
  - `internal/converter/ai.go` - Updated to use stripped body and resolved metadata
  - `internal/config/config.go` - Changed default background_type to "none"
  - Documentation updates across README, docs/, and SKILL.md files

### Migration Guide
No breaking changes. The new CLI flags are optional. If you relied on the previous `background_type: "default"` behavior, explicitly pass `--background-type default` or set it in your config file.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Added Homebrew-friendly multi-platform release archives for `darwin/linux` and `amd64/arm64`, so the project now publishes tarballs that formula-based installs can consume directly.
- Added automatic tap update support in the release workflow, including generated `Formula/md2wechat.rb` output and a release-time push path to `geekjourneyx/homebrew-tap`.

### Changed
- Upgraded the OpenClaw skill metadata to `metadata.clawdbot` with explicit `brew` and `go install` entries, and rewrote the skill body around discovery-first usage instead of installer instructions.
- Promoted `brew install geekjourneyx/tap/md2wechat` as a first-class installation path in user-facing docs while keeping the fixed-version release installer path for checksum-verified installs.
- Standardized version injection around `main.Version` so local builds, release builds, formula tests, and `version --json` verification all resolve the same symbol.

### Fixed
- Fixed Homebrew tap CI so it installs `geekjourneyx/tap/md2wechat` through the tap workflow managed by `setup-homebrew`, avoiding local formula rejection, remote mismatch handling, and post-job cleanup failures.
- Re-audited README, INSTALL, QUICKSTART, FAQ, OPENCLAW, plugin marketplace metadata, and both skill entry points to keep release references aligned at `2.0.3`.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Added a dedicated `install-openclaw.ps1` so Windows OpenClaw installation now has a fixed-version installer that provisions both the skill shell and the CLI instead of relying on the generic CLI-only PowerShell installer.
- Added more agent-friendly installer output for shell and PowerShell flows, including immediate next-step verification commands, PATH repair hints, and explicit `config init` / `capabilities` guidance.

### Changed
- Reworked both Coding Agent and OpenClaw paths so the skill layer is now knowledge-and-workflow only; both paths assume an already-installed `md2wechat` CLI on a formal user-level install path rather than wrapper-managed runtime bootstrapping.
- Standardized the recommended installation path around fixed-version installers and direct copy-paste commands for agents, without requiring `MD2WECHAT_RELEASE_BASE_URL` exports or recommending `go install` as an end-user path.
- Simplified OpenClaw installation so the shell installer provisions the skill shell to `~/.openclaw/skills/md2wechat/` and installs the CLI to the user-level executable path instead of an OpenClaw-private runtime directory.
- Refreshed README, FAQ, INSTALL, QUICKSTART, and OPENCLAW onboarding so “send this to your agent” scripts consistently export PATH before validating `md2wechat`, reducing first-run failures in fresh shells.
- Updated release automation and release checks to match the new OpenClaw contract: no OpenClaw wrapper script, new `install-openclaw.ps1`, and smoke verification against an installed CLI on the environment path.

### Removed
- Removed `skills/md2wechat/scripts/run.sh`; the coding-agent skill no longer acts as a runtime provisioner or wrapper and now documents direct `md2wechat` usage only.
- Removed `platforms/openclaw/md2wechat/scripts/run.sh`; the OpenClaw skill no longer ships a runtime wrapper and instead assumes the CLI has been installed by the fixed-version installer.
- Removed `platforms/openclaw/md2wechat/references/runtime.md`; OpenClaw runtime expectations were folded back into `platforms/openclaw/md2wechat/SKILL.md`.

### Fixed
- Removed coding-agent runtime auto-download during normal execution; the Coding Agent path now rejects missing or mismatched CLIs instead of fetching a remote binary from GitHub Releases at execution time.
- Fixed OpenClaw packaging drift on Windows by pointing skill install metadata to the dedicated OpenClaw PowerShell installer instead of the generic CLI installer.
- Fixed high-signal onboarding drift where README / FAQ / OPENCLAW scripts could validate `md2wechat` before repairing `PATH`, which caused avoidable failures in fresh shells.
- Tightened installer output and OpenClaw guidance so CLI paths, expected skill directory layout, and fixed-version installation flow are described consistently across docs and release metadata.
- Re-audited README, FAQ, INSTALL, QUICKSTART, OPENCLAW, both `SKILL.md` files, installer comments, and release metadata to keep version anchors aligned at `2.0.2`.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Fixed the release workflow so PowerShell installer smoke now runs on `windows-latest` instead of Ubuntu, and PowerShell version smoke parses CLI JSON output correctly.
- Fixed the release workflow binary smoke so release version injection is validated against the actual bundled artifact path.
- Tightened OpenClaw installation guidance to reflect current ClawHub behavior: `clawhub install md2wechat` installs the skill shell only and does not guarantee runtime provisioning.
- Added OpenClaw runtime version checks so the OpenClaw wrapper rejects mismatched runtimes instead of silently executing them.
- Added coding-agent runtime version checks so `skills/md2wechat/scripts/run.sh` only accepts PATH-discovered runtimes when the version matches the current skill version.
- Improved coding-agent runtime fallback behavior so GitHub Releases download failures no longer produce misleading missing-temp-file errors.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- Added a typed publish pipeline with shared article, asset, and action models across `convert`, image generation, draft creation, and image-post flows.
- Added built-in prompt catalog and discovery commands: `capabilities`, `providers`, `themes`, and `prompts`.
- Added built-in image prompt presets with explicit use-case metadata, including cover, infographic, banner, ticket, sketchnote, Apple-keynote, and Victorian engraving variants.
- Added higher-level image generation commands `generate_cover` and `generate_infographic`, plus `generate_image --preset` support.
- Added per-command image model override via `--model` for image generation commands.
- Added dedicated onboarding and operator docs, including configuration, discovery, WeChat credential/IP whitelist, smoke verification, and image provider guides.

### Changed
- Reworked the CLI around a stable machine-readable contract with consistent `success/code/message/schema_version/status/data/error` JSON envelopes.
- Split skill packaging into a coding-agent path (`skills/md2wechat/`) and an OpenClaw path (`platforms/openclaw/md2wechat/`), with platform-specific installation and runtime guidance.
- Promoted built-in embedded assets for default themes, writer styles, and prompt resources so the CLI no longer depends on repo-relative files to function.
- Hardened release engineering with a single `VERSION` source, `release-check`, CI/release gates, checksum-verified assets, and installer smoke tests.
- Standardized discovery-first documentation so README, docs, and both skills point users and agents to CLI capabilities instead of hand-maintained lists.
- Updated default image provider models to match current provider guidance, including `gpt-image-1.5` for OpenAI and newer Gemini defaults.

### Fixed
- Fixed frontmatter title fallback so Markdown titles are resolved correctly when frontmatter omits `title`, including CRLF input handling.
- Fixed remote download and image handling boundaries, including stronger SSRF protection and consistent remote/local image resolution.
- Fixed `convert --json --output` so requested HTML artifacts are written before returning JSON success payloads.
- Fixed `create_image_post --from-markdown` so resolved local and remote image paths work correctly outside the article directory.
- Fixed version-pinned installer behavior so release installers no longer silently drift to newer assets.
- Fixed Gemini image sizing so aspect ratio and image size are forwarded to the official API config, and documented provider-specific size behavior such as ModelScope's `WIDTHxHEIGHT` requirement.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-03-19

### Changed
- Tightened the Markdown-to-WeChat pipeline around shared metadata parsing, image placeholder回填, and remote image download boundaries.
- Expanded command-level and module-level tests across `cmd/md2wechat`, `internal/converter`, `internal/draft`, `internal/humanizer`, `internal/wechat`, and `internal/writer`.
- Promoted checksum-verified, version-pinned release assets and installer scripts as the primary install path.
- Moved the OpenClaw installer to the same version-pinned release + checksum flow as the main CLI installer.
- Added build-once, smoke-same-artifact, release-same-artifact flow to the release workflow.
- Hardened installation and execution docs so fixed-version release assets are the primary install path.
- Added repository execution guidance in `docs/AGENTS.md` for development, validation, and release discipline.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **IsAIRequest 函数修复**: 修复了 `IsAIRequest` 始终返回 `false` 的 bug
  - 原代码使用魔法数字 `14` 进行字符串切片比较，但前缀 `"AI_MODE_REQUEST:"` 实际长度为 16，导致比较永远不匹配
  - `ExtractAIRequest` 同样因切片偏移错误 (`[14:]`) 会在结果中保留 `"T:"` 残留前缀
  - 改用 `strings.HasPrefix` / `strings.TrimPrefix`，与 `generator.go` 中的现有模式保持一致

### Changed
- **aiModePrefix 常量**: 引入包级常量 `aiModePrefix = "AI_MODE_REQUEST:"` 消除魔法数字，所有引用统一使用该常量

### Technical Details
- **Modified Files**: `internal/converter/ai.go`
